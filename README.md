# Predictive-Soil-Mapping

Repository of code for different approaches of predictive mapping of soil properties. Predictive soil mapping (PSM) as presented here is the general approach of using environmental raster data (e.g. digital elevation models, Landsat) to help predictively interpolate between field soil observations to create continuous, mostly finer resolution (~30-250 m) soil maps in a raster format. This workflow is build on picking environmental raster data that represent aspects of soil forming factors: soil = f(climate, organisms, relief, parent material, time). Once the relationship of field data to the raster soil forming factor layers, that can be predicted into areas between observations that are represented by the training sample (interpolation).
